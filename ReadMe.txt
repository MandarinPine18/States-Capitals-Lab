You are to create a states and capitals game.
Create a game class that will actually start the game.
First have the program ask for the user's name.
Use that name to create the game (the constructor for the game class will use this to build the game personally for that person.)
Have the game greet them.
The game will randomly pick a state or capital (I give the user the capital and have them guess the state, once you set up your game, it is an easy switch).
Ask the player to guess the state for that capital.  NOTE: Allow the correct answer to be capitalized or not capitalized. (look up this method).
As the player answers the state or capital correctly, create a "streak counter".
If the player gets an answer wrong, congratulate them and tell them their streak.  Then ask if they want to play again or not.
KEY to this lab:  Once a state has been selected for the question and has been answered, you can not repeat this state again during the game... allowing the player to attempt to guess all 50 states and capitals.
